# DeFi Yield Strategy Analysis (Corrected)
## Wallet: 0x881e625e5c30973b47cee3a0f3ef456012f13f7d

## Executive Summary
This report analyzes a three-step DeFi yield optimization strategy that combines Aave, Pendle, and Magpie protocols on Sonic network. The strategy transforms a single position through multiple protocols to maximize yield. This analysis corrects previous calculations to avoid double-counting yield components.

## Yield Optimization Path Explained

### Step 0: Initial Deposit (Prerequisite)
- **Action**: Deposit 10,000,000 USDC.e into Aave
- **Result**: Received 9,996,580 aUSDC (interest-bearing USDC)
- **Yield**: ~4.92% APY from Aave lending protocol
- **Transaction**: 0x7bac75c7b1305785ec98fdb8771045c44ab820c6bcdecc035c622d26c99e0a0f
- **Date**: March 17, 2025, 07:14:18 PM UTC

### Step 1: Tokenize Yield with Pendle
- **Action**: Convert aUSDC into PT (Principal Tokens) and YT (Yield Tokens)
- **Result**: Received 10,000,022 PT tokens and 10,000,022 YT tokens
- **Yield Structure**:
  * Original yield: ~4.92% APY (Aave yield now captured by YT tokens)
  * Additional yield: ~6.82% APY (from Pendle's tokenization premium for PT tokens)
- **Transaction**: 0xa20bb4b22b87a36eec87643d0f93a421de11a2317a9d352055a992643878cf96
- **Date**: March 17, 2025, 09:48:07 PM UTC

### Step 2: Liquidity Provision on Pendle
- **Action**: Provide PT tokens + USDC to Pendle liquidity pool
- **Result**: Received LP tokens representing pool share
- **Yield Components** (as displayed in Pendle interface):
  * Trading Fees: ~2.47% (estimated from LP yield components)
  * LP Incentives: ~1.65% (estimated from LP yield components)
- **Transaction**: 0x3a9aada37c469f19ff553901dd5c711b1b769dfa32377d56c02de9c62bee4888
- **Date**: March 17, 2025, 09:55:38 PM UTC
- **Details**: 
  * Deposited approximately 4,891,978 PT tokens (about half of the 10M from Step 1)
  * Used `depositMarket` function to provide liquidity to Pendle pool
  * The wallet's position represents a significant portion of the pool's $13.21M total liquidity

### Step 3: Staking on Magpie (Pending Analysis)
- **Action**: Stake LP tokens on Magpie
- **Result**: Earn additional Magpie rewards while maintaining liquidity position
- **Expected Additional Yield**:
  * Additional yield: [TBD] from Magpie rewards
- **Transaction**: [To be identified]

## Corrected Understanding of Yield Distribution

The key insight in this corrected analysis is recognizing how yield is properly distributed across the different tokens without double-counting:

1. **Original Aave Yield (4.92%)**:
   - This yield is entirely captured by the YT tokens
   - This represents the pure yield component from the original aUSDC position

2. **Pendle Tokenization Premium (~6.82%)**:
   - This yield component applies to PT tokens
   - Represents additional yield generated through Pendle's tokenization mechanism
   - This is NOT double-counting the Aave yield, as it's a separate yield component

3. **Liquidity Provision Yield (~4.12%)**:
   - This yield applies only to the PT tokens placed in the liquidity pool
   - Consists of trading fees and LP incentives
   - This is additional yield on top of the PT tokenization premium

## Corrected Yield Calculation

In this corrected calculation, we break down how each portion of the initial capital generates yield:

### Total Initial Capital: 10,000,000 USDC.e (~$10M)

1. **YT Tokens (10,000,022 tokens)**:
   - Capital Value: ~$10M
   - Yield Rate: 4.92% APY (Aave yield)
   - Annual Yield: ~$492,000

2. **PT Tokens in LP (4,891,978 tokens, ~48.9% of total PT)**:
   - Capital Value: ~$4.89M
   - Base Yield Rate: 6.82% APY (Pendle tokenization premium)
   - Additional LP Yield: 4.12% APY (trading fees + LP incentives)
   - Total PT in LP Yield: 10.94% APY
   - Annual Yield: ~$534,982

3. **Remaining PT Tokens (~5,108,044 tokens, ~51.1% of total PT)**:
   - Capital Value: ~$5.11M
   - Yield Rate: 6.82% APY (Pendle tokenization premium)
   - Annual Yield: ~$348,369

### Overall Corrected Yield

| Token Type | Value ($) | Yield Rate | Annual Yield ($) |
|------------|-----------|------------|------------------|
| YT Tokens | $10M | 4.92% | $492,000 |
| PT in LP | $4.89M | 10.94% | $534,982 |
| PT Held | $5.11M | 6.82% | $348,369 |
| **Total** | **$10M** | **13.75%** | **$1,375,351** |

**Note**: The total effective yield of 13.75% is calculated based on the $1,375,351 annual yield on the initial $10M investment. This represents the properly calculated, non-duplicative yield of the strategy.
