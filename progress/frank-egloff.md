2025-04-29 Tue: Discovered DB server instability while troubleshooting Harmony Bot deployment issues - one instance wasn't starting, causing database connection failures. Implemented DB backup, cloned the primary instance, and replaced the malfunctioning one. Fixed Harmony Bot depoyment script by adding retry cycles for DB and Telegram connections, preventing continuous server restarts. Monitoring deployment on dev environment before Wednesday's production release. Closed positions after one-month trial: borrow strategy (Vicuna/Stability) severely impacted by protocol exploit (from 23% APR to -12%), while collateral strategy (Euler) maintained positive but compressed profitability (supply APY: 33.64% → 8.34%, borrow APY: 18% → 8%). Discussed Beefy Protocol research with Artem, scheduled to begin Wednesday.

2025-04-28 Mon: Fixed [Equilibria protocol's retrieve deposit amount logic](https://github.com/harmony-one/shadow-scraper/pull/5) by identifying a constant conversion factor between eqbPENDLE-LPT tokens and UI display values. Multiple contract transfers during deposits were causing inconsistencies, with transaction logs showing minimal eqbPENDLE-LPT amounts instead of actual deposit values. After examining SmartConvertor.sol state-changing methods and analyzing several deposits, implemented a solution using the discovered conversion constant rather than relying on volatile Pendle price. Addressed PR feedback from Artem and continued troubleshooting Harmony Bot deployment issues on fly.io dev server.

----
2025-04-27 Sun: (3.0h) Submitted [PR implementing Equilibria's APR calculations scripts](https://github.com/harmony-one/shadow-scraper/pull/5) to shadow-scraper repo. The primary script calculates user wallet APR on Equilibria protocol. Encountered challenge retrieving accurate user deposit information requiring hardcoding of deposit amount due to transaction complexities: when users deposit into Equilibria, multiple token transfers occur across different contracts, creating discrepancies between on-chain transaction values and what's displayed in both Equilibria and Pendle trades UIs. Current APR for the Equilibria position is 2.70% based on 0.00090264 PENDLE tokens ($0.002960 at $3.28) earned over 4 days from a $10 deposit.

2025-04-25 Fri: Calculated daily [APR](https://github.com/harmony-one/h/blob/main/docs/defi/exports/2025-04-26T04-25-08_equilibria_apr_0x3F5EA5_0x707096.tsv) on Equilibria for PENDLE: 3.35% based on 0.000507 PENDLE tokens ($0.00183 at $3.62) earned over 2 days from a $10 deposit. Created [scripts to research on-chain reward mechanisms](https://github.com/harmony-one/pendle-sonic-rewards/pull/9) trying to discriminate between SY and Pendle rewards, but the exercise confirms that Pendle is the only reward token. The first script identifies reward pool addresses for a given market address and checks reward tokens (confirming that our market distributes only Pendle). The second script calculates user-earned rewards and APR, while the third retrieves user deposit transactions to Equilibria. Analysis of deposit transactions through the PendleBooster contract revealed that each LP token deposit triggers eight token transfers involving PENDLE and eqbPENDLE tokens. LP tokens move from user to Pendle Proxy while eqbPENDLE-LPT tokens are created and sent to Reward Pool. This confirms Equilibria documentation regarding their wrapping of LP tokens into eqb tokens for position tracking and vePENDLE usage for boosted rewards.

2025-04-24 Thu: Examining rewards on Equilibria - received first reward of 0.0003 Pendle ($0.001011 at $3.37 USD/Pendle) on 10 USD deposit, yielding 3.69% APR (matching UI's 3.7% display). Searching for on-chain information to differentiate between Pendle and SY rewards by locating BaseRewardPoolV2 contract address which contains methods for retrieving user/token reward data. For harmony1Bot, resolved [llama_index/chromadb](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-llm-api/pull/31) configuration errors resulting from package version updates triggered by OpenAI and Anthropic changes. These components handle PDF embeddings and URL processing capabilities for Harmony1Bot. Also, updated [OpenAI models](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/376) version and prices, adding o3 (o3-2025-04-16) and 4.1 (gpt-4.1-2025-04-14) models. These changes have not been deployed on 1Bot, due to some deployment issues on 0Bot to test them first.

2025-04-23 Wed: Examined Equilibria's integration with Pendle's SY rewards. The [reward contract](https://sonicscan.org/address/0x2FA11DBcbF955467E6B6f81816B21250F8f3Ac30), from the aUSDC Pool, exclusively holds PENDLE tokens without underlying SY token transactions like aUSDC. Analyzed EPendleSY.sol contract that leverages BaseRewardPoolV2.sol for reward functions (like getReward() method). The _harvest() function in EPendleSY obtains rewards and converts them to PENDLE. While BaseRewardPoolV2 supports multiple reward tokens, on-chain data confirms this specific pool distributes exclusively in PENDLE, consistent with EPendleSY's implementation and other Pendle-staking options in the Equilibria app. Equilibria implements a 7-day streaming distribution mechanism to avoid users depositing before rewards distribution, claiming, and immediately withdrawing without providing sustained liquidity. This explains the APY gap between projected (13.74%) and current (3.6%), as new pools gradually ramp up distribution rates over 7 days until reaching the target APY. Opened a position on Equilibria from LP aUSDC on Pendle. On the Merkl protocol analysis, opened a new position with a new wallet, waiting for rewards over the seven-day period.


2025-04-22 Tue: Investigating Aave/Merit/Merkl rewards distribution on Sonic. Found significant discrepancy between advertised APR (7.23%) and actual returns. After analyzing two claims (0.586 aSonWS on April 16 and 0.249 aSonWS on April 22), calculated effective APR of 223% based on $0.428 USDC rewards from $10 aUSDC investment over 7 days. This gap results from DUTCH_AUCTION distribution mechanism - when participation is low, rewards distribute among fewer users, creating higher individual allocations. All rewards belong to opportunity ID [6966266823213568963](https://api.merkl.xyz/v4/opportunities/6966266823213568963) (with 0 APR and 0 TVL), spanning 11 campaigns total. Merit uses 7-day epochs for rewards calculation, with each campaign representing a 4-hour distribution window for position evaluation. Also, started research of SY rewards on Equilibria, checked documentation and [contracts](https://github.com/eqbtech/equilibria-contracts/tree/main) but encountered issues with entering the boost protocol when attempting to make a deposit.

2025-04-21 Mon: Continuing research on Aave Merit within the Sonic chain, retrieved and confirmed the Merkl [Distribution contract](https://github.com/AngleProtocol/merkl-contracts/blob/main/contracts/Distributor.sol) at Sonic: [0x3ef3d8ba38ebe18db133cec108f4d14ce00dd9ae](https://sonicscan.org//address/0x3Ef3D8bA38EBe18DB133cEc108f4D14CE00Dd9Ae#code). Users must actively claim rewards via the Merkl website since they aren't automatically distributed; the contract manages the Merkle root hash, claim records, and destination address without storing unclaimed user info. Developed a script to check daily user claims; however, while the dashboard indicates $0.12 is available for immediate claim, the API is not returning this data accurately, suggesting a potential synchronization issue. Ongoing efforts are focused on finding a workaround to resolve this discrepancy.

2025-04-18 Fri: Day off for Good Friday. (3.0h) Investigated Luma error reported by user - identified issue in client.generations.list() method which is used to calculate user's queue position and estimates waiting time. [Implemented workaround](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-llm-api/pull/31) by catching the error and returning randomized queue position between 1-3 to maintain functionality. Posted [issue on Luma GitHub repository](https://github.com/lumalabs/lumaai-python/issues/153) for upstream resolution.

2025-04-17 Thu: Day off for Holy Thursday. (1.0h) Responded to user-reported Luma command failure in 1BOT. After initial troubleshooting, temporarily disabled Luma command functionality while developing permanent solution for harmony-llm-api.

2025-04-16 Wed: 2025-04-16 Wed: Investigated Aave Merit program on Sonic revealing non-continuous reward distribution model - program creates short-lived 4-hour distribution windows that represent claiming periods rather than continuous reward accrual. Attempted to match displayed APY with real rewards ($0.27 for 10 USDC deposit), but encountered "PAST" status on all [reward opportunities](https://github.com/harmony-one/pendle-sonic-rewards/pull/8) with APR and TVL zeroed out. For Pendle LP Yield analysis, worked on calculating yield using market state storage but encountered challenges accessing accurate rate values via Gauge Controller contract. Successfully retrieved TVL information for Pendle/Sonic markets using [Python CLI solution](https://github.com/harmony-one/defi-protocol-tvl-tracker).

2025-04-15 Tue: Implemented script to retrieve [Pendle PT rewards](https://github.com/harmony-one/pendle-sonic-rewards/pull/7) calculation by extracting proportionate PT yield for liquidity providers. Solution leverages market's readState method to obtain current pool composition (totalPt and totalSy token amounts) after each contract interaction. Applied PT ratio (PT exposure in LP token) to direct PT yield to calculate exact PT yield component for LP positions, successfully matching UI's displayed values (~0.9%). Founded test wallet supply operation [transaction (tx)](https://sonicscan.org/tx/0xc74a28ff8b115696f6335e402c85f1db9dfd9dfd654bcd98433e4efa496b39a3), and enhanced Aave script with [TSV export functionality](https://github.com/harmony-one/pendle-sonic-rewards/pull/6). Tested Aave APR script with test wallet and [exported result](https://github.com/harmony-one/h/blob/main/docs/defi/exports/2025-04-16T00-38-53_aave_apr_0x5362dB_0x881E62.tsv) getting 0.18470 APR after 25 days.

2025-04-14 Mon: Researched Aave contract mechanics for accurate APR retrieval, focusing on their liquidity index implementation which dynamically adjusts interest rates based supply and demand in the protocol. Discovered Aave's clever balanceOf override that automatically updates user balances with accrued interest without gas expenditure - aTokens (like aSonUSDC) intrinsically represent principal plus accumulated yield. Developed [script to extract Aave APR](https://github.com/harmony-one/pendle-sonic-rewards/pull/6) for specific user wallets and market addresses. Began investigating Pendle PT yield calculation methodology for liquidity provision operations to complete our yield tracking system.

---
2025-04-13 Sun: (6.0h) Implementing APY component extraction tool for Pendle markets on Sonic chain that breaks down returns into PT Yield, Underlying Yield, and LP Yield. Script queries market contracts, Gauge Controller, and token data to produce TSV exports. Currently investigating discrepancies between calculated values and Pendle UI. Added [user LP balance tracking](https://github.com/harmony-one/pendle-sonic-rewards/pull/5) (actual LP tokens held) and active balance monitoring (effective balance for reward calculation including vePENDLE boost) with comprehensive data insights including boost factor analysis. Added UserLPPosition entity to subgraph with Transfer event handling for LP token movements.

2025-04-11 Fri: Expanded Pendle/Sonic subgraph with comprehensive YieldToken contract event tracking, [implementing handlers](https://github.com/harmony-one/pendle-sonic-rewards/pull/5) for YTSwap, YTRedemption, YTYieldClaim, and UserYTBalance events. Developed querying script to analyze and visualize YT reward distribution patterns across protocol participants.

2025-04-10 Thu: Continued PT wstkscUSD yield analysis by examining Pendle contract mechanics, identifying [lastLnImpliedRate as the key parameter driving PT price calculations](https://github.com/harmony-one/pendle-sonic-rewards/pull/4). Verified this rate updates dynamically with each swap/mint/burn transaction in the market. Applied zero-coupon bond pricing approach to understand PT token valuation, where PT price approximates 1/(1 + rate × timeToMaturity/365). Confirmed [market-derived rates (~8.5% APY) align with Pendle UI figures](https://github.com/harmony-one/h/blob/main/docs/defi/exports/2025-04-11T15-06-54_pt_rewards_0x6e4e95.tsv). Analyzed PT pricing behavior showing current values of 0.98-0.99 with 48 days remaining until May 25th maturity, consistent with expected convergence pattern.

2025-04-09 Wed: Met with Artem to analyze APR calculation for [PT wstkscUSD vault positions on Pendle](https://app.pendle.finance/trade/markets/0x6e4e95fab7db1f0524b4b0a05f0b9c96380b7dfa/swap?view=pt&chain=sonic&py=output). Created [script](https://github.com/fegloff/pendle-sonic-rewards/pull/2) distinguishing to fetch pending rewards using contract calls but requires manual deposit info input since subgraph lacks transaction history. Enhanced existing user wallet redeem rewards script with pagination to handle large datasets, TSV export functionality, and command-line parameter support.

2025-04-08 Tue: Implemented subgraph's pagination system for comprehensive data retrieval beyond 1000-row limit with TSV file export functionality via local storage. Integrated Coingecko API for real-time Pendle token price fetching to enable accurate APR calculations. Began SY rewards integration to expand yield analysis capabilities with Standard Yield information for complete protocol reward tracking.

2025-04-07 Mon: Expanded Pendle/Sonic subgraph capabilities with [GaugeController contract events tracking](https://github.com/harmony-one/pendle-sonic-rewards/pull/3), implementing MarketClaimReward and UpdateMarketReward event handlers. Enhanced market metadata retrieval logic for PT, YT and ST contract address resolution. Developed script for querying and displaying market claimed rewards.

___
2025-04-05 Sat: (5.0h) Refactoring entity naming conventions in Pendle/Sonic subgraph to resolve indexing issues. Fixing schema inconsistencies causing entity name conflicts that prevented proper event capture.

2025-04-04 Fri: Fixed Pendle rewards subgraph by refining entity schema design and removing fields causing initialization errors. [Implemented RedeemRewards event handling](https://github.com/harmony-one/pendle-sonic-rewards/pull/2) using index positions as identifiers for client-side resolution. Created get rewards by user address script to test rewards calculation. Successfully deployed subgraph to thegraph services. Resolved harmony1bot Anthropic service balance issue by creating new account, and new API key.

2025-04-03 Thu: Troubleshooting Pendle rewards subgraph indexing issues with PT/YT reward discrimination. Adjusted startBlock initially to accelerate indexing, then reverted to 7830430 (matching DefiLlama). Fixed entity handlers for RedeemRewards events but facing persistent capture challenges. Resolved schema discrepancies causing entity naming confusion in GraphQL API. Verified contract addresses and improved processing logic for PT/YT reward type distinction. Investigating why subgraph only indexes setOverriddenFees events despite proper configuration.

2025-04-02 Wed: Published pendle-sonic-rewards [subgraph](https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/pendle-sonic-rewards/playground) implementing [RedeemRewards event tracking functionality](https://github.com/harmony-one/pendle-sonic-rewards/pull/2). Deployed subgraph to production environment and initiated testing to validate data output structure and accuracy.

2025-04-01 Tue: Discussed protocols taks with Artem for Sonic ecosystem, deciding to maintain separate codebases while sharing ideas to enable cross-verification of results for improved accuracy. Met with Li to discuss new task - verifying reward calculations for [Aave aUSDC pool](https://www.pendle.magpiexyz.io/stake/0x3F5EA53d1160177445B1898afbB16da111182418) on Magpie. Began development of Sonic Pendle Rewards [subgraph](https://github.com/harmony-one/pendle-sonic-rewards).

2025 Q1 Review (24 hours)

In Q1 2025, I focused on working on DeFi analytics on Portfolio Rebalancing, 1Tick automatic rebalancing, and yield analysis; by developing a Python-based command-line DeFi-protocol-TVL-Tracker with a modular provider-protocol architecture, implementing integrations for Euler, SwapX, Shadow, Curve, Aave, and Beets protocols. I built the Sonic Yield Calculator app to analyze how 1tick automatic rebalancer works, implementing vfat.io functionality using the vfat.tools repository which implements a deposit logic on the Sonic chain. Additionally, I created a Portfolio Management prototype with rebalancing algorithms, using a patched Uniswap SDK and direct contract calls. I provided technical support for Ledger hardware wallet integration, identifying M1/Arm64 architecture compatibility issues.

I enhanced our AI infrastructure by integrating multiple models into Harmony1Bot, including Claude 3.7 Sonnet, DeepSeek, and OpenAI's o1. For the harmony-llm-api, I developed a payment system with ONE balance management and a deposit website built within Flask (not yet live). I configured a Harmony Agent using Eliza's framework with GitBook integration, Telegram client deployment, and created both a Harmony character and Harmonious character with a fun, optimistic tone. I conducted detailed yield analysis for multi-protocol strategies combining Aave, Pendle, and Magpie on the Soniclabs chain.

---

2025-03-31 Mon: Completed Pendle reward handling analysis with detailed technical [documentation](https://github.com/harmony-one/h/blob/main/docs/defi/pendle_contract_analysis.md). Examining Pendle's DefiLlama adapters logic, discovering their reliance on MarketFactory events for market information retrieval and TVL calculation mechanisms. Analyzed Pendle event structures for subgraph custom implementation to efficiently index and retrieve rewards information.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

---
2025-03-28 Fri: Exploring Vicuna, Euler and Pendle protocols for comprehensive Borrow/Collateral yield analysis. Discovered DefiLlama lacks support for Sonic chain implementations of Pendle and Euler protocols, requiring alternative data sources. Advanced Pendle protocol reward logic documentation. Initiated subgraph development research for Pendle Protocol on Sonic chain.

2025-03-27 Thu: Analyzing Pendle protocol's reward system through protocol documentation, contract code, and on-chain transactions. Confirmed reward information is stored on-chain via PendleGauge contracts linked to specific markets. Executed and documented test transactions for [borrow](https://github.com/harmony-one/h/blob/main/docs/defi/Borrow%20Collateral%20Yield%20Analysis%20-%20Strategy%201%20(Borrow).tsv) (Vicuna Protocol) and [collateral](https://github.com/harmony-one/h/blob/main/docs/defi/Borrow%20Collateral%20Yield%20Analysis%20-%20Strategy%202%20(Collateral).tsv) yield strategy (Pendle/Euler), capturing performance metrics and transaction flows. Continuing investigation to definitively determine if reward calculation system is fully on-chain.

2025-03-26 Wed: Analyzing Pendle reward system architecture. Identified on-chain reward mechanism through RewardManager and PendleGauge contracts. Found rewards likely use index-based distribution system allocating rewards proportionally based on stake percentage. Need PendleGauge.sol contract address for target market to analyze live transactions and validate findings. Planning 10 USDC.e test position to observe actual reward calculations before confirming complete on-chain implementation. 

2025-03-25 Tue: Analyzing Pendle's smart contract architecture through PendleRouterV4 proxy pattern. Examined Sonic chain transaction and reviewed addLiquidityDualTokenAndPt implementation code to understand token conversion flows. Investigating whether Pendle rewards utilize on-chain or off-chain calculation mechanisms. Analyzed DeFi test requirements for recursive borrowing and Pendle-Euler leverage strategies. Identified specific APYs, leverage ratios, and token details for crafting detailed inquiry addressing testing parameters, budget requirements, and discrepancies between expected rates and actual market conditions on Sonic network. Fixed issue in dalle command for 1Bot to restore image generation functionality.

2025-03-24 Mon: Executed and analyzed complete Aave+Pendle+Magpie yield strategy using my wallet. Performed each step: deposited 17 USDC.e to Aave (0.24%/8.416% yield), minted PT+YT tokens (10.19% yield), created Pendle LP position with additional 64.48 USDC.e liquidity (9.992% yield), and staked LP tokens on Magpie (14.38% yield). Verified APR calculation methodology in Sonic Yield calculator app. Drafted Q1 2025 review summarizing achievements across DeFi analytics, portfolio rebalancing, and AI infrastructure projects.

---
2025-03-23 Sun: (3.0h) Integrated GraphExplorer provider for SwapX protocol. Examined available [subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraphs/Gw1DrPbd1pBNorCWEfyb9i8txJ962qYqqPtuyX6iEH8u) but found it lacks essential TVL query endpoints. Subgraph contains basic vault data and transaction history but missing direct TVL metrics or complete token information required for accurate calculations. 

2025-03-22 Sat: (1.0h) Implemented [Euler protocol integration](https://github.com/harmony-one/defi-protocol-tvl-tracker/pull/2) to the DeFi-protocol-TVL-Tracker. 

2025-03-21 Fri: Sick day-off

2025-03-20 Thu: Got the flu today, limiting work time. Researched Pendle v2 API and analyzed PTaUSDC/USDC pool assets, extracting underlyingApy, impliedApy, and swapFeeApy metrics for more accurate yield estimation. Discovered pool expiration date (August 14, 2025), adjusting investment timeline to 5 months. Updated [report](https://github.com/harmony-one/h/blob/main/docs/sonic_aave_pendle_analysis.md) and created a standalone yield [summary table](https://github.com/harmony-one/h/blob/main/docs/fegloff-attachments.md) showing complete breakdown of all steps (YT tokens, PT in LP, PT held, Magpie staking) with revised rates totaling 21.35%+ APY and projected $963,056+ return over the 5-month period.

2025-03-19 Wed: Completed [detailed yield analysis](https://github.com/harmony-one/h/blob/main/docs/sonic_aave_pendle_analysis.md) for wallet 0x881e625e5c30973b47cee3a0f3ef456012f13f7d using Aave subgraph and Sonic explorer, tracking multi-protocol strategy combining Aave, Pendle, and Magpie. Calculated corrected total APY of 13.75% on $10M investment ($1.38M annually). Strategy breakdown: YT tokens earning 4.92% on $10M, PT tokens in LP earning 10.94% on $4.89M (via trading fees + incentives), and remaining PT tokens earning 6.82% on $5.11M. Magpie staking rewards analysis still pending completion.

2025-03-18 Tue: Synced with Theo and Rika on current initiatives and coordinated with Artem regarding protocol subgraph requirements. Expanded CLI app with Pendle protocol integration using DefiLlama API and implemented Shadow protocol with [Kingdom Subgraph provider](https://github.com/harmony-one/defi-protocol-tvl-tracker/pull/2). Refactored formatter to handle data output factoring to each provider, due to different data availability and added sorting functionality on TVL data.

2025-03-17 Mon: Discovered and implemented [DefiLlama pool endpoint](https://github.com/harmony-one/defi-protocol-tvl-tracker/pull/1) for retrieving granular TVL data. Refactored DefiLlama provider with local storage caching to optimize API consumption. Expanded protocol coverage by adding Curve, Aave and Beets implementations. Enhanced CLI functionality for improved data querying capabilities. Added [Readme](https://github.com/harmony-one/defi-protocol-tvl-tracker/blob/main/README.md) file

---
2025-03-16 Sun: (5.0h) Evaluated DefiLlama API for DeFi TVL tracker and determined it primarily provides chain/protocol-level data without the required pool-specific metrics needed for our use case. Established modular [project architecture with provider-protocol pattern](https://github.com/harmony-one/defi-protocol-tvl-tracker/pull/1), implemented CLI interface, and initialized Silo protocol integration. Exploring alternative approaches using subgraphs and web scraping to extract granular pool market data

2025-03-14 Fri: Extended CL pool deposit logic with wallet integration and token support (S and USDC.e). Resolved [price retrieval issues](https://github.com/harmony-one/sonic-yield-calculator/pull/1) for current, minimum, and maximum values. Continuing to debug mint transaction completion errors.

2025-03-13 Thu: Testing depositApi implementation while resolving implementation errors, troubleshooting excessive gas estimation issue in mint transaction. Enhanced error handling throughout depositApi module.
 
2025-03-12 Wed: Complete [deposit logic implementation](https://github.com/harmony-one/sonic-yield-calculator/pull/1) with new depositApi module that interfaces with NFT Manager Shadow contract (to create a liquidity position with a specific price range, represented as an NFT) and NFT Farm Strategy (to stake the position, enabling auto-rebalancing and configuring reward preferences using the SHADOW token).

2025-03-11 Tue: Developing deposit feature for Sonic Yield Calculator app. Improving pool retrieval logic to enhance CL (Concentrated Liquidity) data extraction ([here](https://github.com/harmony-one/h/blob/main/docs/fegloff-attachments.md#2025-03-11) current app look and feel).

2025-03-10 Mon: Deployed 1Bot with Claude 3.7 Sonnet model integration and implemented both free and paid versions of DeepEeek. After examining FarmStrategy and Automation contracts in vfat.tools repo, gained crucial insights into their pool handling methods, enabling [dynamic CL pool retrieval with detailed display](https://github.com/harmony-one/h/blob/main/docs/fegloff-attachments.md#2025-03-10) similar to vfat.io. Next steps include resolving loading latency issues and implementing position purchasing to analyze 1Tick rebalancing failures.

---
2025-03-09 Sun: (2.0h) Analyzing vfat.tools codebase to understand implementation patterns for automatic rebalancing functionality. Searching for contract interactions with Automation.sol and FarmStrategy contracts due to restricted access to vfat.io private repository.

2025-03-08 Sat: (5.0h) Extended analysis of VFAT's auto-rebalancing system by investigating [Automation.sol](https://github.com/vfat-io/sickle-public/blob/main/contracts/Automation.sol) contract's relationship with FarmStrategy.sol. Discovered Automation.sol functions as orchestration layer with security boundaries for "automator" addresses. Contracts interact through IAutomation interface allowing flexible architecture - Automation.sol handles batch processing with multicall patterns for gas efficiency while FarmStrategy.sol contains actual rebalancing logic. Updated 1Bot with Claude 3.7 Sonnet integration and resolved dependency conflicts.

2025-03-07 Fri: Conducted detailed analysis of [vfat auto-rebalancing mechanism](https://github.com/harmony-one/h/blob/main/docs/fegloff-attachments.md#2025-03-07) for concentrated liquidity positions, specifically examining failure cases in 1-tick ranges (CL50). Examined [FarmStrategy.sol](https://github.com/vfat-io/sickle-public/blob/main/contracts/strategies/FarmStrategy.sol) contract to understand rebalancing implementation in Sonic ecosystem. Identified that rebalancing executes through _compound function with sequential operations: claiming rewards, charging fees, swapping tokens to adjust ratios, depositing into updated price boundary positions, and returning remaining tokens. For CL50 positions (single-tick liquidity concentration for maximum capital efficiency), failure likely stems from high rebalancing frequency requirements during market volatility, causing prohibitive gas costs due to multiple sequential contract interactions required for each rebalance operation.


2025-03-06 Thu: Updated [sonic-yield-calculator](https://github.com/harmony-one/h/blob/main/docs/sonic-yield-calculator.md) app adding an API/Hooks solution for fetching pool data from Sonic pools providers (Equalizer and Shadow). Implemented workaround for contract discovery using known pool/gauge address pairs instead of dynamic discovery. Delivered clean grid-styled interface displaying standardized pool data with TVL, APR calculations and token information.

2025-03-05 Wed: Replicating Uniswap interface logic on the portfolio management prototype. Modified providers definition and Uniswap route handling but still encountering undefined address error. Created vfat project with [basic grid layout](https://github.com/harmony-one/h/blob/main/docs/sonic-yield-calculator.md) and implemented vfat contract calls.

2025-03-04 Tue: Cleansed portfolio management app code and [created PR](https://github.com/harmony-one/portfolio-management-prototype/pull/2) with three swap implementation approaches: Uniswap SDK integration, direct Uniswap contract calls, and SushiSwap contract implementation. Researched vfat.tools implementation following boss's request, planning to build minimal [spreadsheet-like](https://claude.ai/chat/849bac17-af96-43cf-8340-3aa24e10ff76) interface for Sonic blockchain yield farming data displaying pool names, TVL, APR and weekly rewards from Equalizer and Shadow protocols. Users will calculate potential earnings by inputting token amounts against current rates, leveraging existing contract calls from vfat.tools. Future enhancement could include wallet connection for executing staking transactions and claiming rewards directly.

2025-03-03 Mon: Expanded swap implementation approaches while continuing SDK integration efforts. Built direct swap component using hardcoded parameters to bypass complex routing. Implemented SushiSwap integration with custom calldata construction for token exchanges. Addressing MetaMask gas estimation failures and JSON-RPC errors encountered during transaction execution. Cleansing code after testing multiple alternatives to request Aaron's assistance with troubleshooting errors.

---
2025-03-02 Sun: (4.0h) Worked on troubleshooting Uniswap SDK integration on Harmony network. Developed simplified route generation approach with enhanced debugging to isolate specific failure points. Continuing to address persistent invalid address errors despite comprehensive patch application.

2025-03-01 Sat: (4.0h) Performed detailed patch analysis between [harmony-portfolio](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-portfolio) repo and current implementation. Identified and applied missing Harmony network configuration patches. Despite comprehensive patching, continuing to encounter invalid address errors during factory contract resolution.

2025-02-28 Fri: Refactored implementation to utilize Uniswap SDK with Token and NativeCurrency classes. Experimented with various AlphaRouter configurations and explicit Protocol V3 parameters. Identified critical issue with invalid factory address errors—SDK attempting to resolve incorrect factory contract on Harmony chain.

2025-02-27 Thu: Attempted direct contract interaction with Universal Router (0xdAa5Bf7004e33789ce13A2bBE620953B55608B8b) using [ABI](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-portfolio/blob/main/src/abi/router.json).

**2024 Q4 Review** 

In Q4 2024, I developed a proprietary array-based bonding curve contract to address licensing constraints with Mint Club's contracts. The implementation included price calculation and token management functionality, with constructor-initialized stages and standardized curve stages across tokens. I built a Next.js client application with token listing, purchasing, and price calculation features. This work was initially planned for integration with 1.country for domain-based token creation and was later contributed to the pump.fun project.

I enhanced Harmony1Bot by integrating multiple AI models including xAI's Grok, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and OpenAI's o1, while optimizing their command structures for better user interaction. I implemented a sliding window mechanism for infinite chat context and a session-based cleanup system. The bot's reliability improved through Sentry integration across all environments and telegram error notifications. I also developed a video processing system with semantic search and clip generation capabilities, evolving from MoviePy to an FFmpeg-based approach with subtitle handling features. Currently, I'm extending the harmony-llm-api with a JWT-based payment system for general-purpose usage, implementing prepaid user functionality with balance checks and model cost logic.

---
2025 Goals:

I will develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for Harmony to provide our community with real-time, accurate information and development resources. By leveraging established LLM models with our continuously updated knowledge base, I'll create a tool that helps users stay current with Harmony's latest features while providing developers with precise technical guidance for building new applications.

Building on this foundation, I will develop autonomous social agents based on Elon Musk's Grok and Jensen Huang's AI assistants that operate on X and Telegram, leveraging RAG-enhanced AI to generate engaging content and maintain meaningful interactions. The agents will be customizable for different purposes while supporting web3 transactions.

We can combine 1.country with AI-powered meme generation to create cultural content hubs. The idea is for domain owners to generate and curate memes related to their domains, using AI to help with creation and analysis. These memes could then be traded on pump.fun, our existing marketplace, potentially adding value to both the domains and the meme ecosystem in the web3 space.

**2024 Q3 Review (6 hours)** 

I deployed Vertex contracts on Harmony mainnet and testnet, developed a [MockSequencer contract](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-contracts/pull/1), PerpetualFactory for contract creation, enhanced PerpOracle, and created OrderBook contract and OrderBookFactory. To address the lack of Harmony-specific components, I developed a [harmonyClient module](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-web-monorepo-snapshot/pull/2) for mock calls while working on porting API calls. Despite implementing logging events for MatchOrderAMM transactions across various contracts to aid debugging, challenges persisted with processing both MatchOrderAMM and SwapAMM transactions. 

For Harmony1Bot (1Bot), I introduced a [/broadcast](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/365/commits) command for sending Harmony updates to all users and groups, enhanced the /help command to display recent broadcasts, and upgraded VoiceMemo to generate transcriptions for forwarded voice notes. The LlmModelManager class was refactored to accommodate new AI models, including OpenAI's o1-preview and Claude's Sonnet 3.5. New [/o1 and /models commands](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/364) were implemented to improve user interaction with various AI models. I developed a workaround for Telegram's message size limit and enhanced error logging. We migrated 1Bot's database to a new cluster, resolving persistent restart issues. For 1.country, I enabled paid-in-advance [domain rental functionality](https://github.com/harmony-one/1-country.frontend/pull/218), enhancing the platform's capabilities and offering users more flexible payment options. Also, I added a [/subdomains command](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/362) to Harmony1Bot, allowing admin users to enable subdomains for given domains (among other commands). This integration improves the accessibility and management of 1.country services through the bot interface, streamlining the user experience and bridging multiple Harmony services.

Continued [refactoring MockSequencer](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-contracts/pull/1) contract to resolve ITI (ERR_INVALID_TIME) and OCBM (ERR_ORDERS_CANNOT_BE_MATCHED) errors in trade transactions. ITI errors likely stem from time initialization problems in SpotEngine and PerpEngine, triggered when calling getTime on the Endpoint contract.

2024-09-04 Wed: Implementing collateralDeposit method with successful fund transfers and subaccount registration. Balance updates now functioning correctly. Progressing on local testing of submitTransactionsCheckedWithGasLimit to refine logic in Vertex DeFi client app.

2024-09-03 Tue: Implementing executeSlowModeTransactionImmediately in Endpoint to bypass three-day wait for collateralDeposit execution. While fund transfers occur, subaccount registration and balance updates were lagging. Overhauled MockSequencer to leverage Endpoint for immediate slow mode tx processing, OffchainExchange for matchOrderAMM, and Clearinghouse for collateral withdrawals. Enhanced test scripts to monitor subaccount update events, ensuring robust tx lifecycle tracking across the system.

2024-09-02 Mon: Testing submitTransactionsCheckedWithGasLimit locally. DepositCollateral tx not recording subaccount, causing submitTransactionsCheckedWithGasLimit failure. DepositCollateral method throwing "Transaction reverted without a reason string" when interacting with MockSequencer. Next: enhance MockSequencer error logging, verify executeSlowModeTransaction, examine MockSequencer-Endpoint interaction. Suspect root cause in MockSequencer's slow mode tx handling.

---
2024-09-01 Sun: Continued local testing of placeOrder logic. Enhanced contract handler for harmonyClient in Vertex DeFi client app. Implemented getNonce, nSubmissions, and submitTransactionsCheckedWithGasLimit methods. The latter doesn't require sequencer invocation and has simplified requirements compared to submitTransactionsChecked.

2024-08-30 Fri: Attended to personal health matters.

2024-08-29 Thu: Refactored Mock Sequencer and deployed latest changes, including Orderbook modifications, to mainnet. Local testing of placeOrder logic revealed an issue with depositCollateral method. The token requires collateral deposit for Endpoint contract transactions, but the deposit execution encounters a problem with the transfer method, which utilizes the same transaction method as placeOrder logic. Addressing this to ensure full functionality of placeOrder logic. Additionally, for 1country, working on enabling multi-month advance payments for domains. Encountered rent command execution issues, currently resolving.

2024-08-28 Wed: Working on skipping offchain order book in placeOrder logic. Vertex contract review revealed need for Mock Sequencer refactoring due to sequencer-callable Endpoint's submitTransactionsChecked method. Initiating Sequencer refactoring and setting up local tests for submitTransactionsCheck execution.

Implemented placeOrder method with core logic, integrated sell and buy order arrays, and developed matchOrder function for iterating through orders, pairing compatible trades, and executing matches. Optimized deploy and initialization scripts for main, spotEngine, and perpEngine. Conducted local testing to validate changes.

2024-08-22 Thu: Expanded mock calls for market, perp, and index engine on Vertex's Trade page. While porting vertexClient.context.engineClient.getContracts() to Harmony network, discovered Vertex's multi-contract architecture: one OrderBook per product. Refactoring OrderBook contract and implementing OrderBookFactory for efficient contract instance management.

2024-08-21 Wed: Analyzed Order Form logic, identified and fixed execution conversion price (token order/quote token) issue blocking order processing. Added key market mock calls for tokens latest prices (getLatestMarketPrices method) and perp order placement (placeOrder method). Next steps: expand mock call coverage and fix conversion for tokens with prices lower than the quote token.

2024-08-20 Tue: Tested TimesWalletBot on private and group chats; the wallet is linked to the user, not the chat ID. Shared repository URL and key script location with Simao. Diving deeper into Perp/Spot order logic implementation on Vertex Client App.

2024-08-19 Mon: Presented Vertex porting project status to Artem and Simao. Deployed Vertex token to Harmony mainnet, updating Client App with token address and product ID.

2024-08-16 Fri: Deployed and initialized Vertex contract on Harmony mainnet. Launched client app with Harmony Mainnet configuration on fe.country. Resolved token listing issues on [Vertex client Apps' trade page](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-web-monorepo-snapshot/pull/2).

2024-08-15 Thu: [Implemented PerpetualFactory contract](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-contracts/pull/1) to streamline creation of new perpetual contracts. Fixed critical issues in perpetual contract creation process, focusing oracle price setting and proper order book initialization. Refined initialization script to efficiently handle perp engine and post-engine tasks.

2024-08-14 Wed: Integrating USDC, USDT, WBTC, WONE, and ETH from Harmony mainnet into Vertex Decentralized Finance Trade application. Updating frontend components, generating mock data, and modifying contract scripts to support these new tokens. 

2024-08-13 Tue: Fixed [deploy and initialization scripts](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-contracts/pull/1), enhancing Perpetual and PerpOracle contracts. Introduced OrderBook contract and modified hardhat configuration file to support deployments across multiple chains. Progressed with the review of the Vertex trading page, focusing on perpetual operations.

2024-08-12 Mon: Enhanced PerpOracle contract by introducing randomness to the getCustomPrice method, improving price simulation for testing scenarios. Created deploy scripts for Perpetual and PerpOracle contracts. Implemented scripts to set initial custom price for USDC token and add product to PerpEngine contract, facilitating contract initialization. Developing a basic order book contract as an alternative to the OffchainExchange contract.

---
2024-08-09 Fri: Implemented PerpetualContract with constructor parameters for productId, collateral token address, and Oracle address. Incorporated productId to align with PerpEngine's addProduct method, which differs from SpotEngine's token address usage. Enhanced Oracle contract constructor with a boolean parameter, enabling selection between a custom oracle for testing and Chainlink integration for staging/production environments.   

2024-08-08 Thu: Configured fly.io custom domain to link vertex-trade project URL with [fe.country](https://fe.country), following Aaron's DNS mapping of fe.country to the Vertex application. Conducting an ongoing review of the Vertex trading page and associated module, focusing on perpetual trades functionality. Simultaneously analyzing a perpetual contract implementation to gain deeper insights into its structure and behavior.

2024-08-08 Thu: Configured fly.io link vertex-tarde project URL with fe.country, after Aaron mapped fe.country DNS with vertex app. Worked on reviewing Vertex trading page and module to work on mock perp trades. Also, checked perpetual contracts implementations. 

2024-08-07 Wed: Updated [Dockerfile to enhance performance](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-web-monorepo-snapshot/pull/2). Modified quote token to USDT on Harmony test network. Reviewed perpetual contract logic and tokens on Harmony bridge. Talked to Aaron about updating country DNS records to link Vertex fly.io URL to fe.country.

2024-08-06 Tue: Deployed Vertex Trade App on [fly.io](https://vertex-trade.fly.dev/). Configured Dockerfile and fly.toml to work with Next.js monorepo. Fixing deploy errors related to ChainDev handling (supporting multiple chain environments such as local, testnet, harmonyMainnet, among others), package.json build scripts, and Sentry configuration.

2024-08-05 Mon: Refactoring TradingView mock interfaces/types to resolve [build script issues](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-web-monorepo-snapshot/pull/3). Successfully running Vertex Trade App's dev and build scripts locally with Harmony Testnet chain integration. Continuing efforts to deploy Vertex App in fly.io and in Harmony mainnet.

---
2024-08-02 Fri: Working on resolving build command issues for the Vertex Trade App frontend, addressing Tailwind problems, and modifying TradingView mock hooks calls. These build-related challenges remain ongoing and require further attention. Monitored the new cluster PostgreSQL database connection with 1Bot, observing no issues and confirming successful insert statements in logs, chats, stat_bot_command, invoice, and users tables. 

2024-08-01 Thu: Migrated 1Bot database to Soph's new cluster, updating primary keys, foreign keys, Indexes, sequences, and data to match the old Database cluster. Next day's plan: monitor 1Bot/Database integration. For Vertex Defi App frontend, accessed Trade menu page locally after modifying components using TradingView mock data.

2024-07-31 Wed: Created and tested backup of 1Bot database. Soph created a cluster on fly.io from a snapshot of the primary server. This new cluster has all machines working (primary, replica, and zombie). The next step is to connect 1Bot to this new database with the update of all subsequent changes (from the snapshot date). For the Vertex Trade App, completed updating all hooks and other files that use TradingView libraries. Currently testing its functionalities with the rest of the app to ensure successful build and deployment on fly.io with no errors.

2024-07-30 Tue: Updated trading charts hooks and other files to use mock types, turning off the use of TradingView Advance libraries (85% progress). Talked to Soph regarding 1bot payments database issues throwing the Connection terminated unexpectedly error. The database zombie machine is down, and we need to back up the databases before creating a new zombie machine that will complete the architecture (primary, replica, and zombie). Tomorrow, the backup will take place.

2024-07-29 Mon: Checked issues with 1.country site and payment database connection issues on Harmony1Bot. Also worked on the Vertex Trade App mocking TradingView components.

---
2024-07-26 Fri: Finished the [withdraw mock call](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-web-monorepo-snapshot/pull/2) on the Vertex Trade Client. Also added the [VertexToken contract](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-contracts/pull/1) to the Vertex Contracts repo and the logic to deploy it through a Proxy. Updated the deploy and initializer scripts. Finally, Kept working on using mock graphs instead of the TradingView library.

2024-07-25 Thu: Working on a mock call of the Withdraw feature due to its use of the Vertex SDK and query endpoint to handle the call. Also talked to Aaron and started to work on deploying the Vertex Token on the Harmony testnet chain. Finally, investigating a way to work with mock graphs instead of using TradingView Advance and free versions. 

2024-07-24 Wed: Talked to Aaron about the Vertex Trading App and listed the components required to have minimal functionalities. Also, worked on fixing the mock data handling on the withdraw feature, which is disabling the feature.

2024-07-23 Tue: Fixed [formatTimestamp](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-web-monorepo-snapshot/pull/2) method issues with Harmony mock data. Added spot property to harmonyClient to handle spot engine mock calls and added a method to retrieve the maximum withdrawable amount per token. Kept working on the withdrawal feature.

2024-07-22 Mon: Enabled faucet feature to mint testnet funds for Harmony Testnet on Vertex App and currently working on the withdraw feature.

---
2024-07-19 Fri: Checked TradingView data feed integration with Vertex Trade App, and transitioning to a free alternative would require a significant effort. Reviewed and created a list of missing components to port Vertex to Harmony and sent it to Li. Pushed the latest changes to Vertex Defi App [PR](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-web-monorepo-snapshot/pull/2 ) and Vertex contracts [PR](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-contracts/pull/1).  

2024-07-18 Thu: Was able to retrieve the wallet balance using the custom multi-call hook and make a deposit. Checked TradvingView Advance integration with the Trade app, and it seems that using the free version will require significant refactoring. The TradingView library is required to access the Trade feature. Need to check how the datafeed component could affect the refactoring.

2024-07-17 Wed: Kept working on wallet connection logic and fixed an issue not allowing wallet balance to show on the Vertex Trade app. The problem was related to publicClient's multicall method of the Wagmi package. Added custom multicall hook for not supported chains.  

2024-07-16 Tue: Worked on the Vertex Trade app wallet connection (it's not showing wallet balance) and deposit methods on the Harmony Testnet chain. Had to update mock JSON files to use the mockTokens address (it's not enough to update config files). 

2024-07-15 Mon: Deployed Vertex contracts on the testnet chain for testing on the Vertex Trade app, including mock tokens. Refactored the defi app code to support the harmony testnet chain. On 1Bot disabled bard's model command due to its discontinuation to become Gemini (1bot supports Gemini 1.5, too).

---
2024-07-12 Fri: Added MockQuoteToken (for price reference, fee denomination, liquidity provision, margin, and collateral deposits, etc.) and MockUsdcToken, added localhost/hardhat chain for local testing. Added a [deposit script](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-contracts/pull/1) to test the depositCollateral method locally on the contract level because it was not working on the Trade App site, and the local test was successful.

2024-07-11 Thu: Reviewed the deposit operation at the contract level. Refactored deploy and initialization scripts, which fixes contracts initialization, to correctly assign Spot and Perp engines to the endpoint contracts, among other improvements. 

2024-07-10 Wed: Kept working with Vertex contracts and Vertex trade app. Was able to add products to the SpotEngine contract. Also added OffchainExchange initialization. Updating the deploy/initialization script is due to contract prerequisites. 

2024-07-09 Tue: Still had issues adding products to the spot and perp engine contracts. Checked other contracts logic and created script to add spot and perp engines to clearingHouse contract, but had the same error when trying to register a product. Adding some emit events to flagging the contract method logic. On 1Bot, added [content policy violation](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/362) error handling for the /dalle command (pushed live).    

2024-07-08 Mon: Working on adding products to spotEngine and perpEngine contracts. The offchainExchange address is used as the order book contract (one of the required parameters). Had gas issues, working on solving them. Expecting that after fixing the product addition, the deposit logic will be fulfilled.

---
2024-07-05 Fri: Fixed /stats and /botstats commands, which were throwing 410 errors due to [uniswap-v3-harmony](https://api.thegraph.com/subgraphs/name/nick8319/uniswap-v3-harmony) endpoint has been removed. Added error handling on the rest of API calls for stats-related commands. Looking for an alternative to bring uniswap/harmony data. Updated the new contract address after all Vertex public contracts were initialized, but still working on deposit funds logic and checking Vertex SDK.

2024-07-04 Thu: Updated Vertex's initializable contracts, adding [isInitialized method](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-contracts/pull/1) to check if the contract was already initialized. The new method calls Openzeppelin Initializable's _getInitializedVersion() method. Also updated the initializer script and fixed ArbAirdrop (with WONE as an airdropped token) contract initialization issues. Checked the 1bot database on fly.io, and the zombie machine is down (primary and replica machines are up and running). Designed a plan to replace the zombie machine and discussed it with Artem, who will check the fly.io configuration. Also, worked on fixing 1Bot /stats and /botstats commands.

2024-07-03 Wed: Initialized perpEngine and spotEngine and had issues with contract owner initializing arbAirdrop contract (with WONE as airdropped token). Had issues initializing. Checked 1bot logs and stats and had issues with the /stats command, working on fixing database connection issues (Request failed with status code 410 error) . 

2024-07-02 Tue: Initialized [Clearinghouse contract](https://explorer.harmony.one/address/0x1dd343adb90548b7af93abb9086b26e6f9c0f280) on Harmony Mainnet. Working on perpEngine and spotEngine initialization. Reviewed TransparentUpgradeableProxy initialization, which is expecting the initial implementation contract address. According to the [bytecode](https://arbiscan.io/bytecode-decompiler?a=0x7a557dddb3f19eb9d81983b67858b6e73c140ac2) of the implementation contract, the contract includes a method of handling user positions, deposits, and withdrawals, executing trades or swaps, etc. The contract address differs from what Vertex gave on their documentation, so I wrote on Vertex Discord to seek help porting Vertex on a chain different from Aribitrum.

2024-07-01 Mon: Fixed [Verifier contract](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-contracts/pull/1) initialize method issue. Redeployed all contracts after changes were made to the initialize method on the Verifier contract. Reinitialized the Endpoint contract but still had issues with the deposit logic on the Trade App. Kept working on this and other contract initialization methods.

---

**2024 Q2 Review (11 Hours)**

I integrated [GPT-4o to 1Bot](https://x.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1795951553024565259), implemented token-based security and refactored the codebase to facilitate adding new large language models, including Claude, Sonnet, Haiku, and subagent integration. Added model-specific conversation handling and access to Anthropic tool feature, to check stocks and Web3 tokens. I fixed simultaneous command call issues.

Porting and deploying [Vertex Trade](https://github.com/harmony-one/vertex-web-monorepo-snapshot) contracts to Harmony. To address the mono-repo's reliance on the Vertex-typescript-sdk, I implemented a harmonyClient module designed to handle mock calls while facilitating the gradual porting of all API calls to the Harmony network. Additionally, I deployed defi_greeks API which provides endpoints for calculating risk measures and greeks for various financial derivatives and improved 1.country one-and-two-letter domain handling and certificate management.

---
2024-06-30 Sun: Worked on Verifier initialize method.

2024-06-28 Fri: Medical emergency.

2024-06-27 Thu: Medical emergency.

2024-06-26 Wed: Created and deployed MockSequencer and MockSanction contracts. Created initializer script to handle contract initializations. Initialized Endpoint contract, but having issues initializing Verifier contract. Time is limited due to the medical emergency.

2024-06-25 Tue: Medical emergency, catching up on Wednesday.

2024-06-24 Mon: Worked on Portfolio's deposit logic. The deposit logic interacts with the (upgradable) Endpoint contract, calling the depositCollateral method. The Endpoint contract was deployed on Harmony Mainnet, but the initialize method has yet to be called. The method receives a sequencer contract address as a parameter, among other nonpublic contracts. The sequencer contract is linked to the order book, which is the main feature of Vertex mixed architecture. To keep working on the mock Vertex Trade app, I'm working on a mock sequencer contract (needs to create Sactions and OffchainExchange mock contracts, too). The only contract of the Vertex contract repo that uses the sequencer is the Endpoint contract. Also, added a mock method to the subaccount mock client.

---
2024-06-20 Fri: Day off

2024-06-19 Thu: Fixed [BigDecimal type issues](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-web-monorepo-snapshot/pull/2) with Arbitrum and Harmony chains, and now the Portfolio overview and deposit components are showing USDC assets for the Harmony chain. Kept working on deposit logic for the Harmony chain.

2024-06-19 Wed: Added [HarmonyContract mock](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-web-monorepo-snapshot/pull/2) for utility methods that work with contracts through Vertex SDK packages. Kept working on mock methods for Portfolio Overview and deposit components and worked on fixing issues with deposit logic that don't work with Arbitrum and Harmony chains.  

2024-06-18 Tue: Added [TransparentUpgradeableProxy contract](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-contracts/pull/1) to the Vertex Contract repo. This contract is labeled querier contract on the Vertex monorepo. The contract was found through the Arbitrum explorer and still needs to be deployed due to the implementation contract needing to be included as part of the constructor parameters. The portfolio overview page doesn't present errors on loading thanks to the mock methods implemented, but now working on issues related to fund deposit. Still can't deploy the app due to the Trading View API key. 

2024-06-17 Mon: Talked with Theo regarding the Trading View advance charts key, which is required for the trading module. Added other market and context indexer mock calls for the Portfolio Overview and Portfolio Marging Manager components. Working on fixing the formatTimestamp error that appears when changing to the Harmony chain. 

---
2024-06-14 Fri: Added market, context indexer client, and engineClient mock calls. Fixed nextjs.config file/webpack cache issue. Need a [Traving View advanced charts](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/) API key to solve charting_library error that is blocking the App building process.

2024-06-13 Thu: Worked on engineClient, indexerClient, and subaccount mock calls. Had issues with the Trade app's local build. The issue is related to the trading page, which is accessing a dts-bundle-generator module that can't be resolved. Working on workarounds.

2024-06-12 Wed: After trying different approaches to handle the methods specific to the Harmony chain without affecting the functionality of the existing components on Vertex's Trade app (like creating a separate HarmonyVertexClientContextProvider while keeping the existing VertexClientContextProvider), was able to find a more [straightforward approach](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-web-monorepo-snapshot/pull/2) that will help a gradual migration of each method that calls Vertex endpoints. On the data package (@vertex-protocol/web-data), created a harmonyClient module that replicates the structure of the VertexClient class but added the isHarmony attribute to check on what chain the app is working and also included the harmonyClient on VertexClientContext, making it available to the whole app. Made changes on a subaccount and quotePrice hooks to call harmonyClient methods if the isHarmony attribute is true. Still had issues deploying the app on fly.io, and testing the build script locally also didn't work (having issues with CSS directives).    

2024-06-11 Tue: Continue working on mocking [Vertex SDK methods](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-web-monorepo-snapshot/pull/2). Had issues deploying the current Vertext version on fly.io, working on fixing the configuration issues. 

2024-06-10 Mon: Started working on Vertex Client SDK Mock for Vertex app monorepo and also working to deploy the first version of the Trade App on fe.country.  

---
2024-06-07 Fri: Progress on the Vertex porting to Harmony One has encountered a roadblock due to the Vertex mono-repo's dependency on the Vertex-typescript-sdk for querying and executing data related to spot, perp, market, and contracts. The mono-repo utilizes this package to retrieve crucial information, including portfolio chart data, bridge token balance, spot balance, staking state, account staking state, and latest perp prices, among 125 queries. Additionally, have implemented an [input validator](https://github.com/harmony-one/defi_greeks/pull/1) for all POST endpoints in the defi_greeks API to ensure data integrity.    

2024-06-06 Thu: Deployed defi_greeks API to fly.io. [Added](https://github.com/fegloff/defi_greeks/pull/1 ) fly.io configuration, environment, and logger logic, and also [API_DOC](https://github.com/harmony-one/defi_greeks/blob/main/API_DOCS.md) markdown documentation. Kept working on the Vertex Trade App, but still having issues retrieving account information.

2024-06-05 Wed: Implemented the [first version of the defi_greek API](https://github.com/fegloff/defi_greeks/pull/1) with the following endpoints: _/concentrated-liquidity_ (Calculates greeks for concentrated liquidity positions in DeFi protocols), _/squeeth_ (Calculates greeks for Ethereum power perpetual contract positions), _/calculate_greeks_ (Calculates option greeks based on input parameters) and _/health_ endpoints. 

2024-06-04 Tue: Reviewed defi_greek repo, which contains a Rust library with functions to calculate various risk measures and greeks for financial derivatives, including perpetual contracts, options, and concentrated liquidity positions. Working on enabling a webservice (although I have yet to experience with Rust) that exposes these risk calculation functionalities to other applications, contracts, or systems.

2024-06-03 Mon: Kept working on the Vertex Trade App, reviewing contract handling and external API calls using the @tanstack package. The app is not retrieving any financial information (as expected), but also neither account info (e.g. wallet balance), working on that. Also, [forked](https://github.com/fegloff/defi_greeks) the defi_greeks repo and started reviewing perpetuals/liquidity positions in Rust.

2024-06-02 Sun: Working on reviewing the Portfolio page on the Trade app. 

2024-06-01 Sat: Deployed Vertex contracts on Harmony's mainnet and added [multichain deployment support](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-contracts/pull/1). Linked clearinghouse, spotEngine, perpEngine, endpoint, and arbAirdrop contracts to Trade app. Using this [contract](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/harmony-horizen-bridged-usdc-harmony
) for ONE_USDC token 

2024-05-31 Fri: I was sick
 
2024-05-30 Thu: Finished integrating Harmony's [Mainnet and testnet](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-web-monorepo-snapshot/pull/1) as supported chains for the Trade app. Continued working on the Trade app integration.

2024-05-29 Wed: Deployed 1Bot latest changes, and fixed [openai issue](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/362) with system message which limits completion to 100 words. Kept working on trade app porting, had progress on enabling harmonyTestnet. 

2024-05-28 Tue: Fixed simultaneous command calls on 1Bot. When commands run simultaneously, the message context could get mixed, and llms model requests get mixed as well. The solution was to create a single endpoint that handles all llms requests and redirects the request to the respective model resource (as python/flask defined namespace architecture) on harmony-llm-api. This solution requires normalizing streaming handling for Vertex/Gemini models on harmony-llm-api and 1Bot. Now, when a simultaneous command request is handled, each model will be managed by the corresponding LLMs. It will be deployed to 1Bot later today.

2024-05-27 Mon: Deployed GPT-4o model to 1Bot. The following commands and prefixes will work with gpt-4o: _/ask, /gpt, /new, and a. and dot prefixes_. The command _/gpt4_ works for gpt4 model and the command _/gpt32_ for gpt-4-32k model. Fixed an issue with edit telegram messages when processing a stream completion. Also, updated Grammy to the latest version (v1.23.1). Finally, still have issues with simultaneous command calls, and successfully tested a solution on the harmony-llm-api backend that will be implemented tomorrow.

---
2024-05-24 Fri: Fixed 1Bot multiple command handling due to context mixing on llms API calls. Also, added the [Openai GPT-4o model](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/362), linked to /gpto command.

2024-05-23 Thu: Fixed chains configuration issues. Had issues linking the Harmony chain to the wallet connection on the navigation component; working on it. 

2024-05-22 Wed: Kept working on adding [Harmony chain and One token](https://github.com/fegloff/vertex-web-monorepo-snapshot/pull/1) to the Trade App and added HarmonyTestnet chain.

2024-05-21 Tue: Continued working on Vertex's trade app, adding Harmony chain and One token. After Casey's review, sent PR to the Protofire team regarding the explorer block filter and worked on finding the development server issue on the Swap Interface app.

2024-05-20 Mon: Sent [PR](https://github.com/protofire/interface/pull/5) to change tooltip text on Swap Interface (_Network Fee are paid to the ~~Ethereum~~ Harmony network to secure transactions_). This task was delayed due to local deployment issues, which were tested with different node/yarn configurations on Mac M1 and Windows OS, with no success. There is an issue when running GraphQL scripts due to two files missing. The Protofire team sent me the missing files (src/graphql/data/schema.graphql and src/graphql/thegraph/schema.graphql) and the issue was resolved. Also, worked on adding Harmony metadata/token to the Vertex common package and trade app (will send a PR on Tuesday).

Sent the corresponding [PR](https://github.com/protofire/bs-frontend/pull/13). 

2024-05-16 Thu: Despite initial challenges with the Explorer local environment, the issue was that I was working on the wrong repo. Once forked the correct one ([protofire/bs-frontend](https://github.com/protofire/bs-frontend), I was able to make progress. Had personal matters to attend to.   

2024-05-15 Wed: Continued working on Vertex's trade app porting and updating the Explorer app. However, had issues with the local environment with the corepack package and am working on fixing it.

2024-05-07 Tue: Fixed one- and two-letter domain [issues in 1.country](https://github.com/harmony-one/1-country.frontend/pull/217), skipping Web2 registrations because we already control the domains. Also, fixed certificate handling, checking if the certificate needs to be renewed before creating it. After being reviewed by Artem, changes were published. Also, kept working on the swap site update. 

2024-05-06 Mon: Checked the Hyperlance documentation; they provide the contracts on local and remote chains we want to bridge with. Talked with Yuriy about deploying Hyperlane on Harmony. Also, made some text/URL changes on the [Bridge site](https://github.com/harmony-one/layerzero-bridge.frontend/pull/26) and kept working on the requested changes on the Swap webpage.

Also, improved subagent performance by removing unnecessary logic. The Gemini 1.5 model has been checked and is in Preview mode.  

---
2024-04-12 Fri: Improved user prompt to include subagents output and avoid standard openai error "_I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have the ability to browse the internet or access external websites in real-time_". Also, updated the bot's context to include subagent capabilities. Here is the new context: "_You are an AI Bot powered by Harmony. Your strengths are AI API aggregation for chat, image, and voice interactions. Leveraging a suite of sophisticated subagents, you have the capability to perform tasks such as internet browsing and accessing various services. Your responses should be adaptable to the conversation while maintaining brevity, ideally not exceeding 100 words._". Finally worked on adding the PDF subagent. 

2024-04-11 Thu: Tested new subagent feature and refactored bot modules. [Fixed issues](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/362) with multiple URL inquiries, running URL subagent when replying to a message with an URL.

2024-04-04 Thu: Added minimum balance to openAI bot for postpaid commands. Continued [code refactoring](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/362) on Harmony1Bot to ease subagents integration: added llms bot base class (llmsBase) and claudeBot, vertexBot, and llmsBot derived classes. Will continue with the refactoring of openaiBot and converting PDF/URL logic to an subagent-like class. 

2024-04-03 Wed: Fixed PDF/URL parsing issues due to a vector database client/server version mismatch. On [Harmony1bot](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/361), updated Grammy package to the last stable version and made code refactoring to get the latest version of the getChatAdministrators method to fix the database client isGroupWhitelisted method. Had to update the nodejs version to 20 on the Dockerfile. 

2024-04-02 Tue: Fixed the new command logic and the [minimum balance](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/361) to use llmsBot models. Also, fixed the token counter for Anthropopic stream completions. Found the problem with the group whitelisting not working. Finally, fixing an issue with Chromadb that affects PDF/URL handling.  

2024-04-01 Mon: Added conversation per model discrimination on [Harmony1Bot](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/360) (deployed to harmony1bot). Now, you can have one conversation per model. Also added the /o command to work with the opus model. Finally, worked on team reviews.  

---
**2024 Q1 Review (12 hours)**

I added Harmony1Bot features: OpenAI's DALL-E 3, Vision command, and various models from Claude and Vertex. I implemented code snippets support, an Inscription lottery, voice command functionality, and fixed payment logic while upgrading the bot's performance and stream completion. Additionally, I made notable contributions to Harmony-llm-api by adding endpoints for Whisper, Anthropic, PDF inquiry, and Gemini, along with implementing streaming logic.

I contributed to the 1.country project by adding Inscription image rendering for Telegram's Image subscriptions. For the Social Map project, I implemented Whisper logic, added a markers endpoint, refactored the codebase with TypeScript, and improved the app's styling and state management. Lastly, I made enhancements to the Human Protocol project (h.country) by optimizing the Welcome and UserPage route components and improving the app's overall logic.

In optimizing harmony1bot performance, I tackled various technical challenges with targeted features. This included efficiently implementing an image generation queue to handle multiple DALL-E 3 requests and resolving prompt interpretation errors. I also enhanced stream completion for Anthropics and Vertex models, improving user experience by reducing response times. Additionally, integrating voice-command functionality streamlined user interactions, with features such as command reuse improving overall usability and user experience.

2024-03-29 Fri: Day off

2024-03-28 Thu: Day off

2024-03-27 Wed: Added the [CV analysis](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-llm-api/pull/16) endpoint to harmony-llm-api. The endpoint returns the score with the reasoning and three recommendations. Fixed word cutting in Anthropic and Gemini completion and cleaned token information on the completion response. Finally, checked the completion agents feature for Anthropic. The feature is brand new, but a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cxbxmxcx/GPT-Nexus) just added the agent logic for [Anthropic](https://github.com/cxbxmxcx/GPT-Nexus/commit/89694a0bb978e0db1f7e00807bf1bb1d227422b6). We can check that and see how we can include it on harmony1bot. 

2024-03-26 Tue: Fixed [Anthropic namespace](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-llm-api/pull/15) key issue on the harmony-llm-api backend and fixed the URL params default values on the PDF inquiry endpoint. It now serves ONEResume app. Created the harmony0bot database on [elephantsql](https://api.elephantsql.com/), a free service, to deploy the Gemini command for testing. Also, the [LLM chat conversation](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/359) was normalized to avoid errors when passing from/to Claude's and vertex models. Finally, prepared 1Q self-assessment

2024-03-25 Mon: Fixed the [price calculation logic](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/359) of the Gemini command on Harmony1Bot (deployed to harmony0bot)  and a [PDF inquiry endpoint](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-llm-api/pull/15) to harmony-llm-api to use Claude's models. The endpoint accepts a URL of the PDF file and a PDF object. Anthropic doesn't support embeddings, so all inquiry requests need to include the PDF. In case multiple inquiries are required, we can use the openai embedding endpoint available on harmony-llm-api

---
2024-03-22 Fri: Continue working on generative-models.demo, keep having issues deploying locally and in Google Colab. Also fixed the Gemini command completion text on Harmony1Bot. 

2024-03-21 Thu: Added the generative-models.demo repo to Google Colab to have access to the GPU processor. Also, working on configuring the new environment and adding the a flask endpoint.

2024-03-20 Wed: Keep working on Stable video 3D integration. Have issues installing the model on my Mac M1 (Nvidia-related error). Finished the token counter [on harmony-llm-api](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-llm-api/pull/14) and added logic on Harmony1Bot (changes have yet to be pushed to Harmony0bot).

2024-03-19 Tue: Worked on Stable Video 3D, [forked the repo](https://github.com/fegloff/generative-models.demo), set up the dev environment, and installed the model. Also worked on adding a token counter for Gemini requests.

2024-03-18 Mon: Improved [error handling](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-llm-api/pull/13) on the harmony-llm-API backend; still need to make some changes on Harmony1Bot to display the proper error message (for instance, Claude's Sonnet model usually returns an overloaded_error but the bot shows "Error handling your request"). [Deployed to Harmony1Bot](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/358) Opus (/c, /claude, c.), Sonnet (/sonnet, /s) and Hariku (/hariku, /h) commands, and removed emoji on voice command error message. Added the Gemini model to [harmony-llm-api](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-llm-api/pull/14) and [Harmony0Bot](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/359); still need to add pricing on HarmonyBot to deploy to production. Started reviewing [Stable video 3D](https://stability.ai/news/introducing-stable-video-3d).

---
2024-03-15 Fri: Fixed conversation history, added Hariku model (/haiku, /h), update Anthropic models pricing, and added [stream completion](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/358) for Opus and Sonnet models. However, due to wording truncation, kept the Hariku model as rest completion.

2024-03-14 Thu: Added [stream completion](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-llm-api/pull/13) support for harmony-llms-api, and fixed the missing Anthropic module error after deploying. Also, updated Opus and Sonnet prices on [Harmony1Bot](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/357) and started working on stream completion logic. 

2024-03-13 Wed: Fixed Anthropic backend issue with [completion format](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-llm-api/pull/13) and working on deploying issues with the anthropic library. Added opus (/claude, /opus) and sonnet (/claudes, /sonnet command) to [Harmony1Bot](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/357). Fixed AI conversation error after prompt doesn't receive completion, and fixed action message infinite loop after error for LlmsBot and OpenAI bot.   

2024-03-12 Tue: Added Anthropic's Claude create message endpoint in [harmony-llms-api](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony-llm-api/pull/13). Also, added /claude command on the Harmony1Bot local test environment.

2024-03-11 Mon: Updated the recharge message on Harmony1Bot due to some confusion regarding what token to send the funds. Also [SdImagesBot and QRCodeBot](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/356) were disabled due to the shutdown of the Stable Diffusion servers. Finally, worked on enabling [live transcription](https://github.com/harmony-one/1/pull/14) on the Social Map app and configured a test account on the anthropic AI model. 

----
2024-03-08 Fri: Fixed an issue with the Social Map app that sent the [wrong file format](https://github.com/harmony-one/1/pull/13) to the harmony-llm-api for voice transcript.

2024-03-07 Thu: Keep researching Peapods Finance. Here is a good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW87F-l30KI) explaining how the pods work. Also, here is the last [Audit report](https://reports.yaudit.dev/reports/01-2024-Peapods/), but their repo is private. 

2024-03-06 Wed: Started researching Peapods Finance. They do not share the contracts; the only contract shown is their rewarded token, PEAS.

2024-03-05 Tue: Checked Voice AI app functionality after malfunctions reports. Tested the app live and locally, checked the Sentry log where some issues were found, and discussed them with Aaron; they seem to be isolated issues. Will keep monitoring the app in the following days. Also, I worked on a [hotfix](https://github.com/harmony-one/h.country/pull/105) on h.country where a private key import was leaked, and the filter was showing full-text tags.  

---
2024-03-01 Fri: Finished code refactoring and Typescript migration of [ONE Map app](https://github.com/harmony-one/1/pull/12): created ImageCarouselComponent and MemoCarouselComponent, also fixed recording logic.

2024-02-29 Thu: Worked on the following [tasks on h.country](https://github.com/harmony-one/h.country/pull/103): Updated the logic of the clear query param. Also worked on the following [tasks ONE Map](https://github.com/harmony-one/1/pull/11): Refactored MapViewComponent, by creating MapMarker component while migrating the code to Typescript.

2024-02-28 Wed: Worked on the following [tasks on h.country](https://github.com/harmony-one/h.country/pull/101): Updated the display of link actions because most of the time, it took two lines to show 0/B1B1 1760886692 x/17608866 (from address, username, type/username). The proposed change shows the address and the type/username info (0/B1B1 x/17608866). Also, updated the action type color, showing blue if the from address is the same as the page wallet address (key) and yellow otherwise. Also, updated the href to navigate to the payload URL; Fixed filter panel when clicking actions' from/to address. Also worked on the following [tasks ONE Map](https://github.com/harmony-one/1/pull/10): Added a UserContext to handle user wallet address, and useStorage hook to handle local storage.

2024-02-27 Tue: Worked on the following [tasks on h.country](https://github.com/harmony-one/h.country/pull/99): Updated the h.country menu option logic, setting the filter mode to 'All'; updated the selection logic of actions' from/to address, adding the updated page address to the action filter and changing the filter mode to 'address.'

2024-02-26 Mon: Worked on the following [tasks on h.country](https://github.com/harmony-one/h.country/pull/96): Updated the check-in message display logic. There is an issue with some check-in action messages (when syncUserLocation) that were unable to get the location address information, showing an empty message. For those cases, we can try to fetch the information again (calling the nomination API again), and with a second not successful operation, simply not store the check-in on Firebase. Updated the UserPage action filter look and fee. Added onClick logic to the h.country menu option; when clicked, it navigates to the UserPage with no active filters.

---
2024-02-25 Sun: Worked on the following [tasks on h.country](https://github.com/harmony-one/h.country/pull/90): Fixed [object][object] rendering on check-in action messages; fixed runtime error on intersection observer; added Firebase doc's ID to Action Type to set a unique key to every UserAction component to avoid continuing rendering. 

2024-02-24 Sat: Worked on the following [tasks on h.country](https://github.com/harmony-one/h.country/pull/89): Added user's emoji reaction to action messages; added lazy load and intersection observer to handle action list rendering. Also, I worked on [Harmony1Bot](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/353), where I fixed suffix issues and added one inquiry limitation per image on each chat.

2024-02-23 Fri: Worked on the fowolling [tasks on h.country](https://github.com/harmony-one/h.country/pull/71): Disable scroll horizontally on mobile; make text on the selection page (/hash) bigger; limit 10 chars for a tag, and locations in the hashtag section; limit 15 chars for the tag on message section; fix slash and hashtag icon; remove new user self-tagging; fixed location action message overlap; updated URL char truncation; added geolocation after the third topic selected on the welcome page; fixed menu address rendering.

2024-02-22 Thu: Worked on the fowolling [tasks on h.country](https://github.com/harmony-one/h.country/pull/71): Updated action type (self/other) color logic; updated /new route logic and fixed double wallet creation; fixed font styling (grey color and size); fixed manual topic selection tag type logic; update Grommet theme and styled component styling. Also worked on [SocialMap app](https://github.com/harmony-one/1/pull/8), finishing the following tasks: updated footer styling and marker callout styling. 

2024-02-21 Wed: Worked on the fowolling [tasks on h.country](https://github.com/harmony-one/h.country/pull/55): Updated UserPage styling; fixed tags and URL logos cut off and added isUserPage logic; updated filter panel styling and added #one and @ai filter logic; added a topic selection limit on the welcome page; added rendering logic on the welcome page when the topic query param is set.

2024-02-05 Mon: Started briefly working on v.country, a website that records and transcribes voice memos using Openai's Whisper modal. Started working on a [Farcaster](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/) implementation. 

----
2024-02-02 Fri: Added censorship check to dalle text and voice command and included content_policy_violation for [openAI](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/353) errors. Also, added refund handling on openAIs and voiceCommand bots. Finally, disabled the inscription lottery.

2024-01-29 Mon: Worked on integrating [Inscription logic on Harmony1Bot](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/353). Created the share button and 0-cost transaction with call data and added initial logic. 

----
2024-01-26 Fri: Cleaned the [prompt-generated text](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/351/commits/949701af242848e65990691eef4b73499df433c8) on voice command and updated voice command duration up to 30 seconds. Added a [share button](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/353) to Dalle's generated images for inscription logic. 

2024-01-25 Thu: Added payment logic for whisper on voice-command services. [Improved user experience](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/351) by adding voice command reuse to avoid the user repeating the command on each interaction. Updated the conversation queue to store the output format (voice, text) and msgId (to replace the progress message with the completion).   

2024-01-24 Wed: Added the [image (dalle) and talk command](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/351) to the voice-command bot. For dalle, the user has to send a voice note starting with the command image and then the prompt. When a user sends a voice note with the command talk, the AI completion returns as a voice note.

2024-01-23 Tue: Updated the payment logic for pdf/URL web crawling services. Added [voice-command](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/351) functionality for chat GPT and vision features. With voice command, the user sends a voice note starting with the command ('ask' for chat GPT, 'vision' for vision) with the prompt, and the bot generates the completion. For Vision, the voice note has to be a reply to an image. 

2024-01-22 Mon: Fixed [payment issues](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/350) with dalle and Chat GPT commands. The app was storing the token and price usage for the conversation but was not using the token usage information to calculate the input token price. The new DALLE 3 implementation requires the price to be handled as cents.

----

2024-01-17 Wed: Fixed prompts with a [code snippets](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/350) that were handled as URLs and produced an error messages. Fixed an error with vision calls on group chat by requiring vision command on images reply.

2024-01-16 Tue: Added streaming completion to [vision logic](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/348). Also, added /vision command that allows the user to inquire about multiple image URLs. Didn't add vision prompts/completions to the bot conversation because it uses different models, and the content key of the body parameter has a different scheme. 

2024-01-15 Mon: Worked on [deleting prefixes with familiar words](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/349) to increase user experience; the removed words were 'am', 'be', 'ny', 'ha', 'no' from Translate bot.  [Deployed Vision on Harmony1Bot](https://github.com/harmony-one/HarmonyOneBot/pull/348) as a chatCompletion, not as a part of a conversation, due to a different JSON scheme for the content key. On Tuesday, will work on including in the bot conversation the vision's prompt and completion. Also, will add chunk prompting (stream) and /vision command where the user can send an image URL with a prompt.

---
