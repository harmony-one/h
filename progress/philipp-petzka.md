2024-11-06 Wed: This week, I started writing the product description of a Gauge system for 1Swap. The critical point here is the tokenomics. Although veDEXes have proven their PMF, the failure rate of new veDEXes is high due to their tokenomics. My focus is to develop a sustainable token system that dynamically grows with Harmony. For that, I was researching innovative tokenomics and recent standards at other protocols such as IntentX, Liquid Driver, Ramses, Camelot, and others.

You will initially manage product development, curate trader community, and run monthly campaigns. Later, you may as well engage business development, build partnership integrations, and grow marketing reach.

You are expected for startup-like long hours and relentless dedication. You should synchronize daily with the global team, in particular some overlapping hours during 9am to 7pm California hours. We work during weekends but not necessarily with scheduled meetings.
