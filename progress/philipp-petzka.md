Q4 Review

My first 2.5 months at Harmony were all about assessing the status Quo, analyzing the ecosystem for its strengths and weaknesses, and identifying a potential direction where to go from here. In terms of Defi, I developed the strategy to funnel returns offered outside of Harmony into our ecosystem. In addition, there are two user groups that we can target: 

- New/non-native users who dont know about farming
- Power users able to deploy advanced strategies

All product developments will evolve around those two user groups. 

Achieved so far: 

- The treasury farms yield to distribute it to our products after potential strategies have been elaborated and assessed
- 1sDAI (11.5% APY) is deployed on Harmony
- The yield Enhancer product conception is ready and to be deployed (target is within December)
- Several product descriptions targeting more advanced strategies are ready (Lending Market, 1Swap Gauge)

2025 Goals:

My mission for 2025 is to **make Harmony the home of simple DeFi.**

100 Million $ TVL:
Liquidity is crucial for attracting users, teams, and projects, while also providing a seamless experience that drives adoption. Deep liquidity will be achieved by offering competitive returns through a variety of yield strategies within the ecosystem.

10,000 Wallets with a Balance of $200+:
The balance of wallets is a key metric in determining whether users view Harmony as a place to store their funds. To reach this goal, we will target non-native retail investors by offering simple and accessible savings strategies.

10,000 Daily Active Wallets:
Daily active wallets reflect user retention and the success of attracting "Power Users" who naturally influence others. To achieve this goal, we will focus on creating engaging, gamified experiences, advanced high-yield farming strategies, and utility-driven products that keep users returning daily.

2024-11-27 Wed: This week is about to get the Yield enhancer ready. I went through the final concept with Theo and wrote an additional detailed description of the vault mechanics. Besides that, I am ideating how to market the upcoming pump fun launch and started updating the Harmony documentation. Apart from that, I started engaging a little bit with the community and plan to get more feedback from them to see what they want to use or look for.

2024-11-20 Wed: Last week was mostly occupied by DevCon SEA. I connected with many builders and particularly attended events of Base chain to talk with builders there and what they perceive as valuable in the ecosystem. Product-wise, Theo and I decided to launch the Harmony yield enhancer as soon as possible, optimally before the Christmas holidays. I prepared a wireframe + the final product description to be handed to the developers. On Tuesday, I met with Li to discuss the first treasury farming strategy (Buying JLP) and we discussed each step in detail. I also finished the first draft of the 1Swap Gauge product description.

2024-11-10 Sun: The rest of the week I continued to design the tokenomics of the Gauge system for 1Swap. It will be a novel model that is reflexive to 1swaps earnings and therefore aligned to the state of the Harmony ecosystem. Emissions are distributed according to a certain formula incentivizing projects to participate in bribing and to lock up Token supply without worrying too much about its price performance. Since Saturday, DevCon week started in Bangkok and I visited some side events. Besides meeting the Stephens contacts, my goal is to connect with as many builders as possible. 

2024-11-06 Wed: This week, I started writing the product description of a Gauge system for 1Swap. The critical point here is the tokenomics. Although veDEXes have proven their PMF, the failure rate of new veDEXes is high due to their tokenomics. My focus is to develop a sustainable token system that dynamically grows with Harmony. For that, I researched innovative tokenomics and recent standards at other protocols such as IntentX, Liquid Driver, Ramses, Camelot, and others.
