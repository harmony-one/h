# Pendle Protocol Reward System Analysis on Sonic Chain

## Pendle Protocol: Fundamental Structure

### Token Structure

1. **Underlying Yield-Bearing Tokens**
   - Original assets that naturally generate yield (e.g., wstETH, GLP, USDC in lending platforms)
   - These are the tokens users initially deposit into Pendle

2. **Standardized Yield (SY) Tokens**
   - Wrapper tokens created by Pendle (e.g., SY-wstETH, SY-GLP)
   - Standardize how different yield-bearing assets are handled within the protocol
   - Users receive these when depositing underlying tokens

3. **Principal Tokens (PT)**
   - Represent the right to claim the principal amount at maturity
   - Trade at a discount to face value, converging to 1:1 at maturity
   - Offer fixed yield through price appreciation

4. **Yield Tokens (YT)**
   - Represent the right to all yield generated until maturity
   - Value decreases toward zero at maturity
   - Offer variable yield based on the underlying asset's performance

### User Flow

1. User deposits yield-bearing tokens (e.g., wstETH) into Pendle
2. User receives SY tokens (e.g., SY-wstETH)
3. User can:
   - Hold SY tokens (which continue to accrue yield)
   - Split SY tokens into PT and YT components
   - Provide liquidity to Pendle markets (primarily PT/SY pools)

This structure is fundamental to understanding how rewards are generated and distributed, as different token types yield different rewards within the system.

## Reward Sources and Distribution

Within this token structure, rewards in Pendle come from two main sources:

### 1. Protocol Incentives (PENDLE tokens)
- Distributed through the GaugeController contract
- Allocated based on vePENDLE voting weight
- Rates can be verified through the `rewardData()` function
- Primarily incentivize liquidity provision to PT/SY markets

### 2. Underlying Yields
- Generated by the original yield-bearing assets (e.g., staking rewards from wstETH)
- Captured in the SY token and passed through to LPs or YT holders
- Different for each market based on the underlying asset
- May include tokens like ETH, AURA, or other platform-specific rewards

The integration of these reward sources creates a dual incentive structure where users receive both protocol incentives and underlying asset yields when participating in Pendle markets.

## Reward Tracking System: The Index Mechanism

At the core of Pendle's reward system is an index-based tracking mechanism that efficiently accounts for all accrued rewards over time. Understanding this mechanism is essential for tracking actual rewards:

### How the Index System Works

1. **Global Reward Index**: For each reward token, the protocol maintains a global index value that increases as rewards accrue.

2. **User Reward Index**: Each user has their own "last seen" index value for each reward token, indicating the point at which they last received rewards.

3. **Index-Based Calculation**: When a user interacts with the protocol, their rewards are calculated using the formula:
   ```
   rewardDelta = userShares × (currentGlobalIndex - userLastSeenIndex)
   ```

4. **Index Updates**: After calculating rewards, the user's index is updated to match the current global index, ensuring they only receive new rewards in future calculations.

This mechanism allows the protocol to efficiently track rewards for all users without having to update every user's balance whenever new rewards are received. Instead, rewards are effectively calculated "on-demand" when users interact with the protocol.

## Contract Architecture and Relationships

The Pendle reward system is implemented through a well-structured hierarchy of contracts. Understanding these relationships is crucial for tracking how rewards are calculated and distributed.

### Contract Hierarchy and Inheritance

The reward system is organized through the following contract hierarchy:

1. **TokenHelper (Base Abstract Contract)**
   - Provides basic token utility functions
   - Handles balance checking and token transfers
   - Functions: `_selfBalance(token)`, `_transferOut(token, to, amount)`

2. **RewardManagerAbstract (Extends TokenHelper)**
   - Defines core reward tracking structures and the index system
   - Implements the user reward distribution logic
   - Key functions: `_updateAndDistributeRewards()`, `_distributeRewardsPrivate()`
   - Declares virtual functions for child contracts to implement

3. **RewardManager (Extends RewardManagerAbstract)**
   - Implements reward index tracking and updates
   - Manages the global reward state for all tokens
   - Handles the actual transfer of rewards to users
   - Key functions: `_updateRewardIndex()`, `_doTransferOutRewards()`

4. **PendleGauge (Extends RewardManager)**
   - Implements vePENDLE boosting logic
   - Tracks active balances for reward share calculation
   - Handles external reward redemption from both SY and GaugeController
   - Key functions: `_calcVeBoostedLpBalance()`, `_updateUserActiveBalancePrivate()`, `_redeemExternalReward()`

5. **PendleMarket (Concrete Implementation)**
   - Extends PendleGauge for specific markets
   - Tracks LP token balances of users
   - Provides the market-specific staking functions
   - Exposes user-facing interfaces

### Key Interfaces

1. **IPGauge**
   - Defines the external interface for interacting with gauge functionality
   - Implemented by PendleGauge
   - Functions: `totalActiveSupply()`, `activeBalance(user)`, `redeemRewards(user)`

2. **IPVeToken**
   - Interface for interacting with vePENDLE token
   - Used by PendleGauge to calculate boosts
   - Functions: `balanceOf(user)`, `totalSupplyAndBalanceCurrent()`

3. **IPGaugeController**
   - Interface for claiming PENDLE rewards from the gauge controller
   - Used by PendleGauge's `_redeemExternalReward()` function
   - Functions: `redeemMarketReward()`, `pendle()`

4. **IStandardizedYield**
   - Interface for claiming rewards from underlying yield-bearing tokens
   - Used by PendleGauge's `_redeemExternalReward()` function
   - Functions: `claimRewards(to)`, `getRewardTokens()`

## On-Chain Reward Mechanisms

### 1. Core Reward Distribution Functions

Pendle implements a sophisticated index-based reward tracking system with several key functions:

#### a. Reward Index Calculation
```solidity
function _updateRewardIndex() in RewardManager.sol
```
This function:
- Updates global reward indexes for each reward token
- Is triggered at any operation that might affect rewards (LP transfers, reward claims, etc.)
- Calculates new indexes based on: `index += accrued.divDown(totalShares)`
- Handles redemption of external rewards via `_redeemExternalReward()`

#### b. User Reward Distribution
```solidity
function _distributeRewardsPrivate() in RewardManagerAbstract.sol
```
This function:
- Calculates a user's share of rewards based on the index mechanism
- Uses formula: `rewardDelta = userShares × (currentIndex - userIndex)`
- Accumulates rewards without immediate transfer
- Updates user's index to the current global index

#### c. Reward Collection
```solidity
function _doTransferOutRewards() in RewardManager.sol
```
This function:
- Transfers all types of accrued rewards from contract to user
- This includes both PENDLE tokens and any yields from the underlying assets
- Updates accounting of how many rewards remain in the contract
- Returns array of amounts transferred for each reward token

#### d. External Reward Redemption
```solidity
function _redeemExternalReward() in PendleGauge.sol
```
This function:
- Claims rewards from SY (yield token): `IStandardizedYield(SY).claimRewards(address(this))`
- Claims rewards from the GaugeController: `IPGaugeController(gaugeController).redeemMarketReward()`
- Called automatically before updating reward indexes

### 2. Active Balance and Boosting Mechanism

The key to Pendle's reward distribution is the "active balance" concept, which determines a user's share of rewards. The exact implementation from PendleGauge.sol is:

```solidity
function _updateUserActiveBalancePrivate(address user) private {
    assert(user != address(0) && user != address(this));

    uint256 lpBalance = _stakedBalance(user);
    uint256 veBoostedLpBalance = _calcVeBoostedLpBalance(user, lpBalance);

    uint256 newActiveBalance = PMath.min(veBoostedLpBalance, lpBalance);

    totalActiveSupply = totalActiveSupply - activeBalance[user] + newActiveBalance;
    activeBalance[user] = newActiveBalance;
}

function _calcVeBoostedLpBalance(address user, uint256 lpBalance) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
    (uint256 vePendleSupply, uint256 vePendleBalance) = vePENDLE.totalSupplyAndBalanceCurrent(user);
    // Inspired by Curve's Gauge
    uint256 veBoostedLpBalance = (lpBalance * TOKENLESS_PRODUCTION) / 100;
    if (vePendleSupply > 0) {
        veBoostedLpBalance +=
            (((_totalStaked() * vePendleBalance) / vePendleSupply) * (100 - TOKENLESS_PRODUCTION)) /
            100;
    }
    return veBoostedLpBalance;
}
```

Key points about this mechanism:
- `TOKENLESS_PRODUCTION` is set to 40, meaning 40% of rewards are distributed based solely on LP balance
- The remaining 60% of rewards are weighted by vePENDLE holdings
- The formula first calculates a potentially boosted balance, then caps it at the user's actual LP balance
- The constant name "TOKENLESS_PRODUCTION" refers to the portion of rewards that don't require vePENDLE tokens to earn

This implementation ensures users who stake vePENDLE receive boosted rewards proportional to their voting power, while maintaining a base reward rate for all LPs.

### 3. Cross-Chain Voting System

An important aspect of Pendle's reward system on Sonic is its connection to the Ethereum mainnet:

1. **Voting Occurs on Ethereum**:
   - vePENDLE token exists primarily on Ethereum mainnet
   - Users lock PENDLE on Ethereum to obtain vePENDLE
   - vePENDLE holders vote for specific markets (not tokens) to receive PENDLE incentives
   - The voting process is discretionary - vePENDLE holders decide which markets to prioritize based on their own interests
   
2. **Cross-Chain Communication**:
   - Voting results (which determine PENDLE allocation to specific markets) are sent from Ethereum to Sonic via cross-chain messages
   - The GaugeController on Sonic receives these allocations
   - This cross-chain architecture is why rewards on Sonic are influenced by decisions made on Ethereum

3. **Reward Distribution by Token Type**:
   - PENDLE rewards come from the protocol based on voting results
   - Underlying rewards come from the yield-bearing assets:
     - For LP providers: Both PENDLE incentives and underlying SY yields
     - For YT holders: Only yield from the underlying assets
     - For PT holders: Price appreciation (fixed yield) rather than token rewards

It's important to note that vePENDLE holders vote for specific markets (like the PT-wstscUSD market on Sonic), not for specific token types. The underlying rewards are determined by the yield mechanics of the assets themselves, not by voting.

## User-Facing Reward Functions

For users interacting with the Pendle protocol, these are the key functions that handle rewards:

### 1. Claiming Rewards
```solidity
function redeemRewards(address user) in PendleGauge.sol
```
This user-callable function:
- Updates reward accounting and active balance
- Transfers all accrued rewards to the user (both PENDLE and underlying yields)
- Emits `RedeemRewards` event with token amounts
- Returns array of reward amounts in the same order as `getRewardTokens()`

### 2. Reward Token Information
```solidity
function getRewardTokens() in IPGauge interface
```
Returns the list of all reward tokens for a market, combining:
- SY rewards (underlying yield tokens)
- PENDLE tokens (protocol incentives)

### 3. Reward Rate Checking
```solidity
function rewardData(address market) in GaugeController
```
Returns detailed reward information:
- `pendlePerSec`: PENDLE distribution rate per second
- `accumulatedPendle`: Unredeemed PENDLE rewards for the market
- `lastUpdated`: Timestamp of the last reward update
- `incentiveEndsAt`: End time of the current incentive period
