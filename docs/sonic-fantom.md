# Sonic and Fantom Research

## 1. Top Yield Pools

### Sonic's Point System
[Sonic](https://my.soniclabs.com/) has its own unique point reward system, which is divided into three categories:
- **Passive Points**: Earn points by holding whitelisted assets.
- **Activity Points**: Earn points for deploying whitelisted assets.
- **App Points**: Airdrop allocation for participating in the platform's activities.

Currently, for **Passive Points**, there are 7 available assets with point multipliers ranging from **2x** to **6x**.

### Risk & Sustainability Assessment
Sonic is built on **Solana**, which has experienced network outages in the past. However, it benefits from **low fees** and **high throughput**, making it an attractive choice for DeFi activities. While **Sonic’s** ecosystem has a relatively low-risk profile, the past issues with Solana's network stability should be kept in mind.

## 2. Comparison to Solana and Base Strategies

### Sonic vs Solana
Both **Sonic** and **Solana DEXs** emphasize high-speed, low-cost transactions. While **Solana** offers a broader range of pool options and a more established ecosystem, **Sonic** distinguishes itself with more unique pools and reward systems (e.g., the **Sonic Point System**). Since **Sonic** is built on **Solana**, the risk factors associated with both networks are quite comparable.

### Sonic vs Base (Ethereum L2)
**Base**, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution, is focused on **ETH-compatible assets** and has lower gas fees. Its pools primarily involve **ETH** or **ERC20 tokens**, while **Sonic** focuses more on **Solana-native assets**. 

**Base** benefits from **Ethereum’s security** but may face higher risks due to Ethereum’s more complex smart contract environment. On the other hand, **Sonic** offers unique incentives but operates on a network with fewer decentralized applications and support compared to Ethereum’s established ecosystem.
